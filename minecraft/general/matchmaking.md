# Matchmaking

Like lots of other games and in contrary to some other Minecraft networks there should be no sign wall to join games, but a more intelligent matchmaking queue that everybody can join searching for one or multiple minigames together with their party. Every player has a skill based rank \(a simple number that gets bigger on wins and smaller on defeats\) which is used to find other players with a rank close to that.
