# Levels

Levels and the respective amount of XP needed to reach them is calculated through an exponantial term \(That way, players have to gather more XP for the next level\). Rewards aren't pre-defined but rather there is a list of possible rewards for each uprank, which is combined with a multiplier to ensure higher rewards in higher levels. However, special levels might have special rewards, these should be defined here:

| Level | Reward |
| :--- | :--- |
| 42 | _To be determined_ |
| 1337 | _To be determined_ |
